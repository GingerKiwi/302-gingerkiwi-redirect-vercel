# Quick Landing Page for New Version of YarnHelp!

This is a quick landing page for the new version of YarnHelp! The new site will be hosted at [yarnhelp.com](https://yarnhelp.com).

The project has grown from a codepen in early 2022, to a multipage vanilla javascript app. It's grown to the point that components are needed. There's a lot of more apps to be built in various pages, but I was getting tired of copying and pasting the same code over and over again for header, footer, and theme switcher. The current version is at [yarnhelp.app](https://yarnhelp.app).

I'd also like a place to publish knitting and fibre arts articles. So this version is going to include a blog. It will be built in Astro, with Tailwind. Just like the new version of the Ginger Kiwi blog I'll be adding an SQlite backend. First for a simple "like" button for articles. This will set it up to add user accounts, so users can save their favourite yarns and the calculations of how much yarn they need for a project.
